We are working on solutions for firmware upgrade issues. One of the solution is to provide a way to revert back to older versions. Here is the instruction:

* Download a specific version of firmware, unzip it, put it on root directory of your SD card and rename it to FIRMWARE_660R_F.BIN
* Power off your camera, insert your SD card
* Hold the setup button, plug in your USB cable, keep holding the setup button for 12-15 seconds
* Release the button and wait for 3-4 minutes. The camera will reboot and change light status during this time.
* After it is done, the camera light should be flashing yellow (ready to setup)
* Re-setup your device as a new device

Note: Format SDCard in FAT32 first.
